# Flix Develop
Repository for handling new features / experiments with the Flix programming language. This is not a coherent project which is meant to be run. It serves solely the purpose of isolating changes on some feature from the main repo, such that it is more easily tested.

## Commands
- Generate LazyList tests: `bash mkllisttest.sh`
- Generate markdown overview: `bash generate-overview.sh`
- Run Flix Tests: `bash alltests`

## Experiments
- Parallel sorting algos (see sorting algos branch)
- TODO: Matrix & vectors, gaussian elimination i.e. solving systems of linear equation
- Math library? `Additive`, `Multiplicative` type classes?
